    "text": "Starting Robinhood\n\n\n\nThe COVID years\n\n\nMore on Robinhood\n\n\nRobinhood\n\nRising from the shadows of the economic crisis that unfolded in the 2010s,\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. (ticker: HOOD) is a financial services company known for offering commission-free trading of stocks, options, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies through its app and platform. Founded in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood’s mission is to democratize finance and make trading accessible to everyone, especially people who may not have traditionally engaged in the stock market due to high fees or complexity.\n\nRobinhood went public in July 2021, listing its shares on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol HOOD. The IPO was priced at $38 per share, and the company raised around $2.1 billion in the process. Since then, its stock has experienced significant volatility, largely due to factors such as market conditions, user growth, and regulatory scrutiny.\n\n\nKey Features of Robinhood:\n\nZero-Commission Trading: Robinhood popularized commission-free trading, allowing users to buy and sell stocks and options without paying traditional broker fees.\nFractional Shares: This feature enables users to buy portions of high-priced stocks with as little as $1, making investing more accessible.\nCryptocurrency Trading: Robinhood also offers the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others.\nUser-Friendly Interface: The app’s simple design appeals to beginner investors, providing an easy-to-navigate experience.\n\n\n\nPerformance & Growth:\n\nRobinhood has seen massive growth, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when retail trading surged. The platform benefited from the rise of retail traders, often referred to as “memesters,” and events like the GameStop short squeeze in early 2021.\nHowever, the company has faced some challenges, such as regulatory scrutiny (due to its payment-for-order-flow business model) and concerns over its profitability. For example, Robinhood earns revenue by selling customer orders to market makers, a practice that has drawn attention from regulators and investors alike.\nThe stock price has been volatile since its IPO, influenced by market sentiment, trading trends, and the performance of the broader financial markets.\n\n\n\nControversies & Challenges:\n\nPayment for Order Flow: Robinhood’s practice of selling customer orders to market makers has raised concerns about whether users are getting the best prices for their trades.\nSystem Outages: Robinhood has faced criticism for its technical issues, including outages during periods of high trading volume.\nRegulatory Pressure: As Robinhood grows, regulators are increasingly examining its practices, including its crypto trading and options trading services.\n\nIn summary, Robinhood has positioned itself as a major player in the fintech space, challenging traditional brokerage firms with its zero-fee, user-friendly platform. Its stock (HOOD) is closely watched by investors, especially those interested in the broader trend of retail investing and the rise of commission-free trading.\n\nFinancial Performance\nStock Performance\nRobinhood went public in 2021 with an initial price of $38 per share. Over the course of 4+ years, it reached its lowest of $7.95 at the end of 2022 and the maximum of $56.27 at the start of this year. This has largely been attributed to market swings caused by collapse of FTX as well as the the political fortunes of President Trump who regained the white house in Jan 20, 2025.\n\nRobinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) has experienced a significant increase in its stock price over the past year, rising approximately 440%. Several key factors have contributed to this surge:\n\nRobust Financial Performance: In 2024, Robinhood reported its first annual profit of $1.56 per share, surpassing expectations. The company’s revenue grew by 58% to $2.95 billion, with transaction-based revenue increasing by 110% to $1.65 billion. Notably, cryptocurrency transactions played a significant role in this growth.\nExpansion of Cryptocurrency Services: Robinhood has been actively expanding its cryptocurrency trading operations. The acquisition of Bitstamp for $200 million enhanced its crypto offerings, attracting institutional clients and supporting global expansion. This strategic move has positioned the company to capitalize on the growing interest in digital assets.\nRegulatory Developments: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently closed its investigation into Robinhood’s cryptocurrency unit without pursuing any enforcement action. This outcome has alleviated regulatory uncertainties, boosting investor confidence.\nUser Growth and Asset Accumulation: Robinhood’s user base has been steadily increasing. As of July 2024, the platform had 24.2 million funded accounts, up by approximately 70,000 from the previous month. Assets under custody reached $144.5 billion, a 3% rise from the prior month and a 53% increase year-over-year. citeturn0search1\nProduct Innovation and Global Expansion: The company has been proactive in introducing new products and expanding internationally. Initiatives such as the Robinhood Wallet, enhanced services for Gold customers, and retirement account programs have been launched. Additionally, Robinhood has expanded into markets in the UK and Europe, broadening its global presence.\n\nThese developments have collectively contributed to the substantial rise in Robinhood’s stock price, reflecting the company’s strengthened market position and growth prospects.\nRobinhood’s Strategic Moves and Regulatory Relief Propel Stock Surge\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. has demonstrated notable user growth from 2022 through early 2025. Here’s a detailed overview:\nRobinhood Plots Expansion To Capture Share Of $84 Trillion Wealth Transfer\nReuters - US SEC closes investigation into Robinhood’s crypto arm with no action\nRobinhood Plans Ambitious Crypto Expansion Under Trump Administration"

    "title": "Short History of Retail Trading",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Electronic Trading Platform / Retail Stock Trading Landscape\nETP / RST platforms are a relatively new phenomenon that gained prominence in the COVID period because it allowed retail investors to focus around an activity and make money in insolation. While electronic trading first started in the 1970s, and developed significantly during the 1990s and 2000s with the spread of the Internet. It was slow in replaceing traditional floor trading and telephone trading in the following 20 years. The use of electronic means to trade saw two waves of rapid growth - in the late 90s and 2000s with the advent and widespread adoption of the Internet and the late 2010s and early 2020s thanks to a very unexpecte instigator, the COVID pandemic.\nPrevious trading routines required the engagement of a broker or remisier who are essentially licensed agents trading on behalf of the customers. The rise of ETPs that took over the role and able to execute trades programmatically and in real time helped democratize retails trading. To be sure, most early adopters of electronic trading in the COVID lockdown period are young men who have had their social and work life severely restricted, and had to find an outlet.Those who were out of a job due to the lockdown or restricted working hours had to find alternate sources of income.They would come into contact trading through friends or acquaintances in their social circles, recommending stocks or commodities to invest in.\n\nBecause trading through a broker held certain restrictions - buying and selling in a larger lots of 1000 shares, having a higher margin, etc., young men of limited financial means did not find it easy to trade through some of the larger brokerages or established platforms such as Vanguard, E*Trade, TD Ameritrade, to name a few.\nElectronic Retail Platforms such as Robinhood allowed this demographics to participate in the trading game and a few to make good gains, which when circulated in social media, engendered more interest and envy in the hitherto fringe user group. In the same timeframe, another form of investing was also silently gaining traction - cryptocurrencies. The main standard-bearer of which, the bitcoin has been the liberator of the masses from fiat currency or a downright scam, depending on which side of the camp the reader is in. What not to be denied is that Crytos such as bitcoin, ethers, or even fiat currency based tokens such as USDT encouraged young investors to take part in the money markets even though they might be relatively unsophisticated players. They come with their own lingo, subculture, investing mindset, and through their numbers and transaction volume progressively became a force to be reckoned with.\n\\(\\frac{a}{b} + \\sigma + \\sum^{T}_{n=1}\\)\nThe market of electronic retail trading started way back in 1970s, . Although it overtook traditional floor and telephony trading in the intermittent years, the speed was comparatively lackadaisical and sporadic, especially in the US and Europe. It really took root as improbable gang of maverick investors made WallStreetBets into a cultural movement, moving from the fringes of the internet into the spotlight of the investing world, in the span of 2 years. In the course, it upended the global financial markets from the United States to Europe, and Asia, ultimately revolutionizing how a new generation of investors perceive money and investing. WallStreetBets, a subreddit revolving around some risky trading advice, was turned into one of the most disruptive social media in the financial space. The relatively unsophisticated and unpolished forum harnessed the power of memes and trolling to forge a new kind of online identity among new players who wanted their portion of the wealth creation pie. This mixed with the social upheaval and turmoil experienced during the COVID period spoke a generation of young men who were seeking to establish themselves and their financial well-being in society.\nYear 2020 will be remembered as an awkward year. The existence of a new virus was reported by the Chinese authorities to the WHO on the last day of 2019, even though there are still many doubts about the real origin of the virus and questions have been raised concerning how the Chinese government handled both the spread of the virus and the information. The truth is that a few weeks later, as travelers unknowingly contributed to the spread of the novel coronavirus, cases started to be reported in other countries. A few weeks later, on March 11, 2020, with a total of 118,000 cases reported in 114 countries and 4,291 deaths, the WHO declared the coronavirus a “pandemic”. A pandemic is, by definition, an epidemic that spreads simultaneously around the world. By the end of March, most of the countries in the globe had to implement quarantines as the only way to stop the spread. Countries like Italy and Spain were already experiencing a collapse in their Health Systems. Schools were shut down worldwide, together with shopping malls, airports, restaurants, hotels and many more businesses. The global economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. Economists like the Spanish Santiago Niño-Becerra warn with horror that such a brake on the world economy has no comparison at least in the capitalist era1. Because all the previous world-wide economic crises in this capitalist era, be it the one of 1929 or the one of 2008, did not suppose a halt on the activity and the production, as the COVID-19 has done. People being forced to stay at home, the use of Internet became a need. Activities that could no longer be done in person had to be done through the virtual: shopping, work, education, communication, entertainment. Of course the Internet was already widespread, of course Amazon, home office, Facebook, Netflix and distance education already existed, but with coronavirus they became the new normal and to most of the people, they became the only way to work, shop, teach, and so on. In a New York Times article2, critic and writer Jorge Carrión has depicted the situation derived from COVID-19 pandemic as a paradox: what accelerated the digitalization process worldwide was Biology, and not Technology. The coronavirus, a virus spread through close contact or objects has multiplied our dependency on devices. A process that would have taken decades in normal conditions was vertiginously accelerated. The digitalization was already on its way, very rapidly winning importance, but the coronavirus seems to have accelerated the process. And many of the activities and business that started to be done only through the Internet will remain that way. Companies have reported that they save a lot of money having their employees working through home office, psychiatrists have discovered that Zoom or video calls were as good as face to face appointments, and millions of local shops created their on-line stores and made then work, just to mention a few examples. Because the truth is that the long term consequences of the pandemic, from an economic and social point of view, are yet to be determined.\nSome of the most obvious and immediate consequences of the pandemic and the quarantines were an increase in Internet traffic, and also an increase in the value of applications and platforms. Our dependence on screens and virtuality has also generated a data chain of enormous proportions for companies that sell or offer services, such as Google, Amazon, social networks and on demand platforms. What can be said by now is that many areas of the economy and many areas of our lives have changed through this accelerated virtualization process. It seems that each specific area has experimented changes, many of them unpredicted, and that “normality” will be different.\n\nResources\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock market and investor online word of mouth, 2024, Zhu, et al"
