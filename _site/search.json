    "text": "Starting Robinhood\n\n\n\nRobinhood\n\nRising from the shadows of the economic crisis that unfolded in the 2010s,\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. (ticker: HOOD) is a financial services company known for offering commission-free trading of stocks, options, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies through its app and platform. Founded in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood’s mission is to democratize finance and make trading accessible to everyone, especially people who may not have traditionally engaged in the stock market due to high fees or complexity.\n\nRobinhood went public in July 2021, listing its shares on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol HOOD. The IPO was priced at $38 per share, and the company raised around $2.1 billion in the process. Since then, its stock has experienced significant volatility, largely due to factors such as market conditions, user growth, and regulatory scrutiny.\n\n\nKey Features of Robinhood:\n\nZero-Commission Trading: Robinhood popularized commission-free trading, allowing users to buy and sell stocks and options without paying traditional broker fees.\nFractional Shares: This feature enables users to buy portions of high-priced stocks with as little as $1, making investing more accessible.\nCryptocurrency Trading: Robinhood also offers the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others.\nUser-Friendly Interface: The app’s simple design appeals to beginner investors, providing an easy-to-navigate experience.\n\n\n\nPerformance & Growth:\n\nRobinhood has seen massive growth, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when retail trading surged. The platform benefited from the rise of retail traders, often referred to as “memesters,” and events like the GameStop short squeeze in early 2021.\nHowever, the company has faced some challenges, such as regulatory scrutiny (due to its payment-for-order-flow business model) and concerns over its profitability. For example, Robinhood earns revenue by selling customer orders to market makers, a practice that has drawn attention from regulators and investors alike.\nThe stock price has been volatile since its IPO, influenced by market sentiment, trading trends, and the performance of the broader financial markets.\n\n\n\nControversies & Challenges:\n\nPayment for Order Flow: Robinhood’s practice of selling customer orders to market makers has raised concerns about whether users are getting the best prices for their trades.\nSystem Outages: Robinhood has faced criticism for its technical issues, including outages during periods of high trading volume.\nRegulatory Pressure: As Robinhood grows, regulators are increasingly examining its practices, including its crypto trading and options trading services.\n\nIn summary, Robinhood has positioned itself as a major player in the fintech space, challenging traditional brokerage firms with its zero-fee, user-friendly platform. Its stock (HOOD) is closely watched by investors, especially those interested in the broader trend of retail investing and the rise of commission-free trading.\n\nFinancial Performance\nStock Performance\nRobinhood went public in 2021 with an initial price of $38 per share. Over the course of 4+ years, it reached its lowest of $7.95 at the end of 2022 and the maximum of $56.27 at the start of this year. This has largely been attributed to market swings caused by collapse of FTX as well as the the political fortunes of President Trump who regained the white house in Jan 20, 2025.\n\nRobinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) has experienced a significant increase in its stock price over the past year, rising approximately 440%. Several key factors have contributed to this surge:\n\nRobust Financial Performance: In 2024, Robinhood reported its first annual profit of $1.56 per share, surpassing expectations. The company’s revenue grew by 58% to $2.95 billion, with transaction-based revenue increasing by 110% to $1.65 billion. Notably, cryptocurrency transactions played a significant role in this growth.\nExpansion of Cryptocurrency Services: Robinhood has been actively expanding its cryptocurrency trading operations. The acquisition of Bitstamp for $200 million enhanced its crypto offerings, attracting institutional clients and supporting global expansion. This strategic move has positioned the company to capitalize on the growing interest in digital assets.\nRegulatory Developments: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently closed its investigation into Robinhood’s cryptocurrency unit without pursuing any enforcement action. This outcome has alleviated regulatory uncertainties, boosting investor confidence.\nUser Growth and Asset Accumulation: Robinhood’s user base has been steadily increasing. As of July 2024, the platform had 24.2 million funded accounts, up by approximately 70,000 from the previous month. Assets under custody reached $144.5 billion, a 3% rise from the prior month and a 53% increase year-over-year. citeturn0search1\nProduct Innovation and Global Expansion: The company has been proactive in introducing new products and expanding internationally. Initiatives such as the Robinhood Wallet, enhanced services for Gold customers, and retirement account programs have been launched. Additionally, Robinhood has expanded into markets in the UK and Europe, broadening its global presence.\n\nThese developments have collectively contributed to the substantial rise in Robinhood’s stock price, reflecting the company’s strengthened market position and growth prospects.\nRobinhood’s Strategic Moves and Regulatory Relief Propel Stock Surge\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. has demonstrated notable user growth from 2022 through early 2025. Here’s a detailed overview:\n\nWhy would Robinhood continue to grow?\nGrowth of the U.S. Retail Investing Market: An Analyst’s Assessment ###### Market Size and Participation Growth The U.S. retail investing landscape has undergone a transformative expansion over the past five years, as illustrated in our charts based on authoritative data sources. Total Household Equity Ownership has shown remarkable growth, increasing from $21.6 trillion in 2019 to $32.5 trillion by mid-2023 - a 50% increase in just 3.5 years (Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Report, 2023). This growth significantly outpaced GDP growth during the same period, indicating deeper market participation rather than merely reflecting economic expansion. Retail Investor Participation Rate has steadily climbed from 53% in 2018 to approximately 60% in 2023 (FINRA Foundation National Financial Capability Study, 2023). This represents an additional 17+ million American households entering the equities market within a five-year period, one of the largest expansions of retail participation in modern financial history.\n\nPlatform Growth and Democratization\nThe competitive landscape for retail brokerage services has been dramatically reshaped, as our platform growth chart demonstrates: Robinhood’s user base expanded from 7.2 million in 2019 to 22.8 million by Q2 2023 - a 216% increase in four years (Robinhood 10-Q/10-K filings, 2019-2023). This explosive growth coincided with their commission-free trading model becoming the industry standard.\n\nCharles Schwab grew from 12.3 million to 34 million users during the same period, partly through organic growth and partly through strategic acquisitions including TD Ameritrade (Charles Schwab Annual Reports, 2019-2023).\nWebull, virtually unknown in 2019 with approximately 1 million users, has emerged as a significant competitor with 11.2 million users by 2023 according to company disclosures.\nJ.D. Power’s 2023 U.S. Self-Directed Investor Satisfaction Study found that self-directed investing platforms collectively grew assets by 66% from 2019-2022, significantly outpacing traditionally managed accounts.\n\n\n\nAsset Allocation Trends\nThe composition of retail portfolios has evolved considerably: ETF Assets have grown from $4.4 trillion in 2019 to $7.2 trillion by 2023 (Investment Company Institute Factbook, 2023). The retail segment accounts for approximately 40% of these assets, with particularly strong growth in thematic, sector, and ESG-focused ETFs.\nOptions Trading Volume attributable to retail investors has seen compound annual growth of approximately 35% from 2019 to 2022, according to Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) market data reports. This growth was particularly pronounced during the 2020-2021 period.\nCryptocurrency Adoption among retail investors increased from 7% of U.S. adults in 2019 to 16% by 2023, according to Pew Research Center’s digital asset surveys, though this remains a more volatile component of retail portfolios.\n\nDemographic Evolution\nThe retail investor base has undergone substantial demographic shifts:\n\nAge Distribution has skewed significantly younger, as shown in our demographics chart based on Morgan Stanley Research (2023). Investors under 35 now comprise 45% of all retail investors, up from 30% in 2019. The under-25 segment has more than doubled its representation.\nFirst-Time Investors now have a median age of 34, down from 42 before the pandemic (Fidelity Investments’ “2023 Retail Investor Outlook”). This demographic shift has significant implications for investment time horizons and risk preferences. Income Diversification has been notable, with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2022) documenting that the pandemic period saw the largest increase in stock market participation among households earning under $100,000 annually in recorded history.\nMarket Structure Impact This retail growth has fundamentally altered market dynamics: Retail Order Flow now accounts for approximately 24% of total U.S. equity trading volume, up from 10% in 2019 (NYSE Research, 2023). This shift has increased the importance of retail sentiment in price discovery processes.\n\nMarket Microstructure has adapted to accommodate retail preferences, with the SEC’s 2023 market structure proposals directly addressing the growing influence of retail investors in the National Market System.\nTrading Patterns have evolved, with Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (2022) noting retail investors are more likely to increase buying activity during market declines than institutional investors, potentially providing a “cushioning effect” during volatility.\n\n\nFuture Outlook\nForward projections from leading financial institutions indicate sustained growth:\n\nDeloitte’s “Retail Investor Outlook 2023-2028” projects retail investing assets to grow at a 6.5% CAGR through 2028, reaching approximately $45 trillion.\nMcKinsey’s “Global Wealth Report” (2023) forecasts U.S. retail investment accounts to increase by 15-20% by 2027, with growth particularly concentrated in digital-first platforms.\nSIFMA Analysis projects retail investor market participation will reach 63-65% of U.S. households by 2025, approaching the historical high of 65.9% set in 2007.\n\nThe retail investing revolution represents a structural shift in U.S. capital markets that extends beyond cyclical trends, with significant implications for market structure, asset pricing models, and financial services business strategies in the years ahead.Retry\n\n\n\n\nResources\nRobinhood Plots Expansion To Capture Share Of $84 Trillion Wealth Transfer\nReuters - US SEC closes investigation into Robinhood’s crypto arm with no action\nRobinhood Plans Ambitious Crypto Expansion Under Trump Administration"

    "text": "The Electronic Trading Platform / Retail Stock Trading Landscape\nETP / RST platforms are a relatively new phenomenon that gained prominence in the COVID period because it allowed retail investors to focus around an activity and make money in insolation. While electronic trading first started in the 1970s, and developed significantly during the 1990s and 2000s with the spread of the Internet. It was slow in replaceing traditional floor trading and telephone trading in the following 20 years. The use of electronic means to trade saw two waves of rapid growth - in the late 90s and 2000s with the advent and widespread adoption of the Internet and the late 2010s and early 2020s thanks to a very unexpected instigator, the COVID pandemic (Zhu, et al).\nPrevious trading routines required the engagement of a broker or remisier who are essentially licensed agents trading on behalf of the customers. The rise of ETPs that took over the role and able to execute trades programmatically and in real time helped democratize retails trading. To be sure, most early adopters of electronic trading in the COVID lockdown period are young men who have had their social and work life severely restricted, and had to find an outlet.Those who were out of a job due to the lockdown or restricted working hours had to find alternate sources of income.They would come into contact trading through friends or acquaintances in their social circles, recommending stocks or commodities to invest in.\n\nBecause trading through a broker held certain restrictions - buying and selling in a larger lots of 1000 shares, having a higher margin, etc., young men of limited financial means did not find it easy to trade through some of the larger brokerages or established platforms such as Vanguard, E*Trade, TD Ameritrade, to name a few.\nElectronic Retail Platforms such as Robinhood allowed this demographics to participate in the trading game and a few to make good gains, which when circulated in social media, engendered more interest and envy in the hitherto fringe user group. In the same timeframe, another form of investing was also silently gaining traction - cryptocurrencies. The main standard-bearer of which, the bitcoin has been the liberator of the masses from fiat currency or a downright scam, depending on which side of the camp the reader is in. What not to be denied is that Crytos such as bitcoin, ethers, or even fiat currency based tokens such as USDT encouraged young investors to take part in the money markets even though they might be relatively unsophisticated players. They come with their own lingo, subculture, investing mindset, and through their numbers and transaction volume progressively became a force to be reckoned with.\n\\(\\frac{a}{b} + \\sigma + \\sum^{T}_{n=1}\\)\nThe market of electronic retail trading started way back in 1970s, . Although it overtook traditional floor and telephony trading in the intermittent years, the speed was comparatively lackadaisical and sporadic, especially in the US and Europe. It really took root as improbable gang of maverick investors made WallStreetBets into a cultural movement, moving from the fringes of the internet into the spotlight of the investing world, in the span of 2 years. In the course, it upended the global financial markets from the United States to Europe, and Asia, ultimately revolutionizing how a new generation of investors perceive money and investing. WallStreetBets, a subreddit revolving around some risky trading advice, was turned into one of the most disruptive social media in the financial space. The relatively unsophisticated and unpolished forum harnessed the power of memes and trolling to forge a new kind of online identity among new players who wanted their portion of the wealth creation pie. This mixed with the social upheaval and turmoil experienced during the COVID period spoke a generation of young men who were seeking to establish themselves and their financial well-being in society.\n\nRetail Trading Boom during the COVID Pandemic\nThe COVID pandemic created the perfect landscape for retail trading to grow and boom. The number of users, especially Robinhood skyrocketed when it tripled its user base from “just” 10 million in late 2019 to over 30 million by early 2021.\n\n[User growth of the major platforms in the COVID period]\nThis growth wasn’t just incremental; it represented a paradigm shift in the share of market participation from veteran investors to young comparatively inexperienced people with less wealth and investing knowledge - a new investing demographic has emerged. What is especially noteworthy is the acceleration that occurred right after the March 2020 market crash. It didn’t scare off the same group of retail investors, instead the market decline counterintuitively attracted them in record numbers, and created a trading volume explosion.\n\n[Growth of trading volume pre-pandemic to post-pandemic]\nThe chart above shows the daily trading volume quadrupling from about 6 million trades per day pre-pandemic to over 24 million by Q1 2021. This was reflected not just by more people trading, it was also more people trading more frequently.\nThis trend was underpinned by serveral factors:\n\nHeightened market volatility during the pandemic creating more perceived opportunities\nLockdown boredom driving engagement with trading apps as a social and potenially profitable activity\nThe gamification of trading platforms and the and addictive lure of frequent trading.\n\n\n\nDemographic Revolution\nThe most profound change in retail trading was the trader demographic itself. Before COVID, retail investing skewed heavily toward older demographics, where over 70% of retail investors being 40 years old and over. By 2021 - right in the middle of the pandemic, this pattern had completely replaced by a new phenomenon, - nearly 60% of active retail traders are under 40.\n\n[Demographics of retail trading pre- and post-pandemic]\nThis demographic shift has significant implications for:\n\nInvestment styles (greater risk tolerance)\nAsset preferences (more interest in growth stocks, cryptos versus dividend stocks or real estate)\nTime horizons (younger investors theoretically have longer investment timelines)\nCommunication and feedback channels (social media instead of brokers and remisiers)\n\n\n\nNew Account Creation\n\n[Concentration of new account creation growth]\nThe chart above illustrates the concentration of this account growth was during the pandemic period. In 2020, three times as many new brokerage accounts were opened compared to 2019. Even more remarkably, Q1 2021 alone saw more account openings than all of 2019.\n\n\nMotivating Factors\n\n[Pie chart of the reaons people get into retail investing]\nThe leading factor — stimulus payments — reflects how government pandemic relief became unexpectedly redirected into financial markets. With approximately $3,200 in direct payments to most American adults over the course of the pandemic, a significant portion found its way into trading accounts.\nThe second factor — market opportunity — illustrates how many traders viewed the March 2020 crash as a buying opportunity instead of as a warning sign. The “buy the dip” mentality was reinforced by the quick market recovery that followed.\nThe third factor—extra time at home—highlights the unique circumstance of lockdowns. Many workers, particularly higher-income knowledge workers who maintained their salaries while working remotely, suddenly had extra hours in their day previously consumed by commuting and office presence.\n\n\nLong-Term Implications\nThe data reveals that the pandemic didn’t just accelerate existing trends — it fundamentally altered retail trading pattern in the ways that will likely persist:\n\nPermanently lower barriers to entry: Zero-commission trading is now industry standard\nDemographic redistribution: Younger investors entered markets decades earlier than historical patterns\nSocial investing: Investment communities on platforms like Reddit became powerful market forces\nChanged volatility patterns: Higher retail participation has changed market microstructure and volatility\n\nThe growth of retail trading during COVID-19 wasn’t merely a cyclical phenomenon but a structural shift in market participation that continues to reshape financial markets today.\n\nResources\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock market and investor online word of mouth - Zhu, X., Li, S., Srinivasan, K. and Lash, M.T. (2024). Decision Support Systems, [online] 176, p.114074. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2023.114074.\n\n‌ 2."
