#### Dropshipping

In the world of finance, predicting the future isn’t about guesswork—it’s about pro forma financial statements. These forward-looking documents help businesses model potential financial scenarios, enabling data-driven decision-making (Investopedia, 2023).


#### Wish

An ecommerce company that doesn't have any warehouses, logistics, simply surviving on sales commissions would create certain limitations.


```{ojs}
athletes = FileAttachment("athletes.csv").csv({typed: true})

Plot.plot({
  grid: true,
  facet: {
    data: athletes,
    y: "Gender"
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.rectY(
      athletes, 
      Plot.binX({y: "count"}, {x: "Height (cm)", fill: "Gender"})
    ),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```
