  color: {scheme: "spectral", legend: true},
  marks: [

      op_income,
      {
        x: "Year",
        y: "Operating Income(USD millions)",
        fill: "Company"
      } 
    ),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

```{ojs}
athletes = FileAttachment("athletes.csv").csv({typed: true})

Plot.plot({
  grid: true,
  facet: {
    data: athletes,
    y: "Gender"
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.rectY(
      athletes, 
      Plot.binX({y: "count"}, {x: "Height (cm)", fill: "Gender"})
    ),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
