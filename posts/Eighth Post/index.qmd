#### Dropshipping

In the world of finance, predicting the future isn’t about guesswork—it’s about pro forma financial statements. These forward-looking documents help businesses model potential financial scenarios, enabling data-driven decision-making (Investopedia, 2023).


#### Wish

A pro forma financial statement is a financial report prepared based on assumptions or hypothetical events rather than actual past transactions. These statements help in assessing:
- New product launches – Estimating revenue and expenses
- Business expansion – Financial impact of entering new markets
- Debt or equity changes – Understanding new financing effects
- Mergers and acquisitions – Projecting combined financial outcomes (Harvard Business School Online, n.d.).

These tools help businesses visualize future financial performance and make informed decisions.
